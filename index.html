          Dear family and friends!,
        </p>
        <p>
          What a great year it's been. We are so grateful to have grown closer to our Savior, Jesus Christ, this year. I think we feel it more acutely because we're learning and about talking about him more every day. This has been prompted by our more-directed study of the scriptures through the Come, Follow Me program our prophet invited us to follow this year.  It's been a great blessing to our family to prepare our thoughts and share our testimonies of Him together.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, Christmastime is finally here!  Christ is so good. He inspires feelings of love and peace in each of us. He is what our family -- and the world -- needs. What a blessing, then, that He offers all He has to each of us. It seems that our spirits remember His generosity with us especially at Christmas.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our family is doing well. We've had some of the challenges of life to deal with, naturally.  Mostly, we have many gifts of God to celebrate this year.  Namely, we watched our little girl, Eliza, grow into her first year. She is an angel, at the epicenter of the home. Everyone loves her, and she has brought us much peace and joy.
        </p>
        <p>
          When not kissing Eliza, the rest of us have enjoyed some highlights this year. Jake has expanded his art habit with more illustration and graphic design. April has discovered she can even enjoy sewing and created many fun and useful items. Dallin (and his mom!) earned his Arrow of Light award in Cub Scouts. Mackenzie finished reading the Book of Mormon for the first time on her own. Alaura is blossoming like a Latin flower of Espanol in Spanish immersion class at school. While not on his bike, Benson has discovered math, working it into most conversations. Eliza has learned to kiss her dad (sometimes!), tease, walk, climb stairs and other things, and is on the verge of talking.  
        </p>
        <p>
          As we look back on the year, there is only gratitude. The coming year will bring new challenges and new blessings from a generous Father in Heaven. We pray to be equal to the challenge and stay faithful to our divine guide, Jesus Christ. We pray you find your own blessings from heaven this year.  Merry Christmas!
